Follow the project's Python style rules:

- Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid 1-2 character names.
- Prefer type annotations for public APIs and exported functions.
- Use early returns / guard clauses; keep nesting shallow.
- Add docstrings for modules and public functions.
- Don't catch exceptions silently; always handle or re-raise with context.
- Use `black` formatting and `ruff` lint rules.
