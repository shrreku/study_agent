Guidelines for repository documentation:

- Use `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for architecture and design; keep it up-to-date when adding new services.
- When referencing external docs, prefer canonical sources (official docs, GitHub repos).
- Use code fences for any code snippets and include a brief explanation.
- Keep issue and ticket templates in `tasks.md` and `tickets/`.
- Use relative links when referencing files in the repo (e.g., `[PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)`).
